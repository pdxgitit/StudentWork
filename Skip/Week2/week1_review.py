# Write a function that takes two numbers and returns a random number between
# and inclusive of the inputs (i.e. make_random(5, 10) should return 5 <= num <= 10)
import random


# Write a function that:
# Given a string, if its length is at least 3, add 'ing' to its end.
# Unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case add 'ly' instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Return the resulting string.

# ('hail' -> 'hailing')
# ('swiming' -> 'swimingly')
# ('do' -> 'do')


# write a function that asks the user to input a date in the following format:
# "mm/dd/yyy"
# convert this into a more readable date i.e.:
# "05/24/2003" -> "May 24, 2003"
# start by writing down the steps you will need to take as a series of comments

# user = input('Date: mm/dd/yyyy ')




# Write a recursive function called count_down(n) that takes an integer n and
# prints every number from n down to one.  Note that for a function that just prints
# numbers you won't need to return anything.
