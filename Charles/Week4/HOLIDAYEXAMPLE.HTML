   <p>As a hobby board gamer, I'm sure you'd love to avoid a holiday gathering full of the same old Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley games and inject a little newness into the tradition. But when the whole family gets together for the holidays, it's important to read the room and save some of the more complicated board games for your regular game night. Here's a list of fun, family-friendly, and most importantly, easy-to-learn board games that are perfect for getting everyone to the table for a good time.</p>

   <p>For this list, I also recommend against using any advanced or expansion versions of these games and instead stick to the basics. That way you keep from unnecessarily confusing Grandma or little Billy when it's their turn to play.</p>

   <h3>Camel Up</h3>

   <p class="synop">Released: 2014 | Publisher: Z-Man Games | No. of players 2-8</p>

   <p>Camel Up is simple to play and understand, but there is plenty of depth to keep both newcomers and seasoned pros glued to the action until the end. Here players compete as onlookers betting on racing camels to try to guess which animal will cross the finish line first. There's plenty of opportunity to try to manipulate the race, or even bet instead on which camel will come in last in order to score points. Just tell any skeptics that it's just like going to the horse races, but without any of the crowds or uncomfortable smell.</p>

   <h3>King of Tokyo</h3>

   <p class="synop">Released: 2011 | Publisher: IELLO | No. of players 2-6</p>

   <p>With its creative spin on the popular Milton Bradley dice game Yahtzee, King of Tokyo is not only a fun time but also offers a familiar entry point for those players over the holidays who might not otherwise be inclined to try something new. In this game from famed designer Richard Garfield, players each assume the role of a monster bent on trampling on the city of Tokyo in a clever mash up of dice rolling mixed with simple king of the mountain-style game play. Monsters work together to clobber the player in Tokyo in order to take its place and then themselves become the target of gnashing teeth and radioactive breath. It's fun, fast, and silly fun for everyone at the table.</p>


   <h3>Machi Koro</h3>

   <p class="synop">Released: 2014 | Publisher: IDW Games | No. of players 2-4</p>

   <p>Machi Koro is all about building the ideal city. There are farms to plant, factories to run, and money to be made in this fast-paced card and dice game that was first released in Japan before coming to North America in 2014. Here players take turns rolling dice, with some or all players at the table getting to activate certain buildings under their control that correspond to the value rolled. Players also earn money to buy new buildings, and eventually construct impressive landmarks in a push to create the most impressive city at the table. Just think of it as Monopoly, but without the countless hours and family feuds that Parker Brothers' infamous classic always manages to inspire.</p>

   <h3>Tsuro: The Game of the Path</h3>

   <p class="synop">Released: 2004 | Publisher: WizKids Games | No. of players 2-8</p>

   <p>Tsuro is a strategy game that's perfect the more intellectual gatherings, but remains simple enough for almost anyone to enjoy. This is a beautiful abstract game with an Asian spiritual theme. In its attempt to demonstrate the â€œclassic quest for enlightenment," this game creates a fun and quick-playing board experience for the whole family. Players lay tiles illustrating an array of twisting lines and then move their individual game piece along a path created by adjacent tiles while trying to remain on the board and not run into any other players. Tsuro rewards smart play, but can also get a touch chaotic as more players join the fun.</p>

   <h3>Ticket to Ride</h3>

   <p class="synop">Released: 2004 | Publisher: Days of Wonder | No. of players 2-5</p>

   <p>This is the easiest choice when looking for a game to play with family over the holidays. In Ticket to Ride players are building railroad lines across America by drawing and playing colored cards and then placing their trains on the board on tracks that match the color and number of cards played. It's easy to learn, and requires just the right amount of strategy to be engaging while remaining fun and accessible for almost anyone. There are even chances to occasionally block other players from scoring points, suitable revenge against them for taking the last slice of pumpkin pie.</p>

   <p>There are many more games available that are great for getting family members to the table this holiday season. Hanabi and Forbidden Island and two more fun choices worth checking out. Just remember to keep it simple and you might just end up being the person who made the party memorable; not the schmuck who brought it to a screeching halt. I've been both.<p>
